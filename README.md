This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Motivation

This is a slightly flippant little app that tells you if it’s raining by making a request to the OpenWeather API with the user’s current location.
If it’s raining the app tells you that you need a jacket. I created this because I want to make my code more robust by getting to grips with typescript.

It is as yet untested in all use cases as it was cloudy but otherwise dry when I made it. x

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
